## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Arnold, a Research Fellow in Geospatial Data Science at the Curtin for Agribusiness Profitability (C4AP) of the Centre for Crop and Disease Management, Curtin University. 
I lead and support the C4AP data scientists and analysts in the development of different data pipelines (i.e., ingestion, cleaning, and visualization) to build the Agri-analytics Hub for the Western Australian grain farmers.

I received a PhD (by Research) in Environmental Science from the University of the Philippines Los BaÃ±os (UPLB). 
Prior to joining Curtin, I am an Associate Professor at the Department of Community and Environmental Resource Planning (DCERP), College of Human Ecology (CHE), UPLB. 
I am the founding Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Human Ecology and Sustainability. I also serve as reviewer for numerous journals and sit on the editorial board of SN Social Sciences, PeerJ, and Spatial Information Research.
